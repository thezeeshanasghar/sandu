# System Evolution Documentation

## 1. Current System Architecture
The existing system operates as a monolithic application hosted on a single EC2 instance:

    subgraph "Current Monolithic Architecture"
    Client[Web/Mobile Clients]
    API[API Gateway/Load Balancer]
    EC2[Single EC2 Instance]
    S3[S3 Storage]
    
    Client --> API
    API --> EC2
    EC2 --> S3
    
    subgraph "Monolith Components"
        EC2 --> Auth[Authentication]
        EC2 --> Ingest[Image Ingest]
        EC2 --> Search[Search Engine]
        EC2 --> Index[Indexing]
        EC2 --> Serve[Image Serving]
        EC2 --> Store[Storage Manager]
    end
    end
```

### Components
- Single EC2 instance hosting all services
- API Gateway/Load Balancer for traffic handling
- S3 Storage for image data
- Monolithic codebase containing:
  - Authentication system
  - Image ingestion service
  - Search engine
  - Indexing system
  - Image serving capability
  - Storage management
  - Third-party API integrations

### Limitations
- Limited scalability
- Single point of failure
- Tight coupling between components
- Difficult to maintain and update
- Resource constraints
- Limited deployment flexibility

## 2. Infrastructure Modernization

### Load Balancing Enhancement
- Implementation of Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- SSL/TLS termination
- Health checks implementation
- Traffic distribution capabilities

### Content Delivery
- Integration of Global CDN
- Edge caching for improved performance
- Reduced latency for global users
- Better handling of static assets

## 3. Service Decomposition

### Microservices Architecture
Each monolithic component is transformed into an independent service:

    subgraph "Modernized Architecture"
    Client[Web/Mobile Clients]
    CDN[Global CDN]
    ALB[Application Load Balancer]
    
    subgraph "Services"
        Auth[Auth Service]
        Search[Search Service]
        Ingest[Image Ingest Service]
        Serve[Image Serving Service]
        Index[Indexing Service]
    end
    
    subgraph "Storage"
        ES[Elasticsearch]
        S3[S3 - Image Storage]
        Cache[Redis Cache]
    end
    
    Client --> CDN
    CDN --> ALB
    ALB --> Auth
    ALB --> Search
    ALB --> Serve
    ALB --> Ingest
    ALB --> Index
    
    Search --> ES
    Serve --> S3
    Serve --> Cache
    Ingest --> S3
    Index --> ES
    end
```
