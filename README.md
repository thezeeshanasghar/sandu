## 1. Where We Started

### Current Architecture
Let's look at our current setup - it's a classic monolith running on a single EC2 instance:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Current Monolithic Architecture"
    Client[Web/Mobile Clients]
    API[API Gateway/Load Balancer]
    EC2[Single EC2 Instance]
    S3[S3 Storage]
    
    Client --> API
    API --> EC2
    EC2 --> S3
    
    subgraph "Monolith Components"
        EC2 --> Auth[Authentication]
        EC2 --> Ingest[Image Ingest]
        EC2 --> Search[Search Engine]
        EC2 --> Index[Indexing]
        EC2 --> Serve[Image Serving]
        EC2 --> Store[Storage Manager]
    end
    end
```

### What We Have Now
Here's what we're working with:
- Everything runs on one EC2 instance (yes, really!)
- We've got a basic API Gateway/Load Balancer handling traffic
- S3 takes care of our image storage
- Our monolithic app includes:
  - Authentication system
  - Image ingestion service
  - Search engine
  - Image serving
  - Storage management
  - Third-party API integrations

### Pain Points We're Solving
- Can't scale when we need to
- If our server goes down, everything goes down
- All our code is tightly coupled - change one thing, worry about everything
- Updates are becoming a nightmare
- We're constantly running into resource limits
- Deployments are rigid and risky

## 2. Our Transformation Plan

### Our Game Plan
Here's how we'll tackle this transformation:
1. First up: Setting up our new infrastructure backbone with ALB
2. Adding CDN for that sweet performance boost
3. Breaking down our monolith, one service at a time
4. Supercharging our storage layer
5. Getting our container orchestra playing in harmony
6. Adding eyes and ears to our system (observability)
7. Locking everything down tight (security)
8. Making sure we're not breaking the bank (cost optimization)

### What We'll Gain
Here's what makes this journey worth it:
- Scale up or down instantly based on demand
- Problems in one service won't crash everything else
- Deploy updates without sweating bullets
- See exactly what's happening in our system
- Use (and pay for) only what we need
- Keep costs under control
- Happy developers who can ship faster
- Lightning-fast experience for our users

## 3. Infrastructure Modernization

### Frontend Layer

## Our Game Plan
Here's how we'll tackle this transformation:
1. First up: Setting up our new infrastructure backbone with ALB
2. Adding CDN for that sweet performance boost
3. Breaking down our monolith, one service at a time
4. Supercharging our storage layer
5. Getting our container orchestra playing in harmony
6. Adding eyes and ears to our system (observability)
7. Locking everything down tight (security)
8. Making sure we're not breaking the bank (cost optimization)

## What We'll Gain
Here's what makes this journey worth it:
- Scale up or down instantly based on demand
- Problems in one service won't crash everything else
- Deploy updates without sweating bullets
- See exactly what's happening in our system
- Use (and pay for) only what we need
- Keep costs under control
- Happy developers who can ship faster
- Lightning-fast experience for our users

## Let's Talk: Key Discussion Points

### 1. Scaling Like a Pro

Our infrastructure scales both horizontally and vertically based on real-world usage patterns. Here's what triggers our scaling:

#### Scaling Metrics
- **CPU Utilization** > 70% for 2 minutes
- **Memory Usage** > 80% for 2 minutes
- **Request Count** > 1000 requests/second
- **Response Time** > 500ms for 95th percentile
- **Queue Length** > 100 messages

Each service has its own scaling rules:
- Image Processing: CPU and memory usage
- Search Service: Query latency and queue depth
- Auth Service: Request count and active sessions
- Storage Service: IOPS and throughput

### 2. Going Beyond AWS?

Yep, we do step outside the AWS ecosystem when it makes sense! Here's where and why:

#### Third-Party Services We Use
- **Cloudflare** for DDoS protection and edge caching
  - *Why?* Better global presence and specialized security features
  - *Trade-off:* Additional cost vs. AWS Shield, but better protection

- **Elasticsearch Cloud** for search functionality
  - *Why?* Managed service expertise and easier scaling
  - *Trade-off:* Higher cost than self-managed OpenSearch, but less operational overhead

- **DataDog** for advanced monitoring
  - *Why?* Better visualization and AI-driven insights
  - *Trade-off:* More expensive than CloudWatch, but more powerful features

### 3. Zero-Downtime? No Sweat!

Here's our zero-downtime deployment strategy:

1. **Blue-Green Deployments**
   - Maintain two identical environments
   - Test new version in 'Green'
   - Switch traffic gradually using Route53 weighted routing

2. **Rolling Updates in EKS**
   - Update one pod at a time
   - Health checks before adding to load balancer
   - Automatic rollback if health checks fail

### 4. Infrastructure as Code FTW!

#### How We Manage It
- **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning
- **Helm** for Kubernetes deployments
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- **AWS CDK** for application resources

#### Multi-Cloud/Region Support

**Different Providers? Absolutely!**
- Infrastructure code is provider-agnostic
- Use of standard Docker containers
- Abstract provider-specific services

**Multi-Region? You Bet!**
- Active-Active setup in multiple regions
- Global Route53 for traffic distribution
- Cross-region data replication
- Regional auto-scaling groups

### 5. Keep Your Eyes on the Prize

#### Critical Metrics We Track
1. **User Experience**
   - Page load time
   - API response time
   - Error rates
   - User session duration

2. **System Health**
   - Service availability
   - Resource utilization
   - Cache hit rates
   - Queue depths

3. **Business Metrics**
   - Successful transactions
   - Active users
   - Storage usage
   - Cost per request

#### Our Monitoring Stack
- DataDog for application monitoring
- ELK Stack for log analysis
- Grafana for visualization
- PagerDuty for alerting

### 6. Developer Access Made Safe

Here's how our devs get in:

1. **Access Layers**
   - AWS SSO integration
   - Role-based access control
   - Time-based access tokens
   - VPN requirement for sensitive operations

2. **Development Tools**
   - kubectl with EKS authentication
   - AWS Cloud9 for cloud-based IDE
   - Bastion hosts for direct access
   - Local development environments with Docker

### 7. Smart Storage, Happy Wallet

#### Cost Optimization Strategies
1. **S3 Lifecycle Management**
   - Frequently accessed data → Standard storage
   - After 30 days → Infrequent Access
   - After 90 days → Glacier
   - Delete after 1 year (configurable)

2. **Intelligent Tiering**
   - Automatic movement between tiers
   - Pattern-based optimization
   - Cost analysis and recommendations

3. **Cache Optimization**
   - Redis caching for hot data
   - CDN caching for static assets
   - Browser caching policies

4. **Data Compression**
   - Image compression on upload
   - Text compression for logs
   - Database compression
