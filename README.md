# System Architecture Modernization Project

## Overview
This project documents the modernization of a monolithic image processing system into a scalable, cloud-native microservices architecture. The transformation aims to improve scalability, maintainability, and operational efficiency while ensuring high availability and performance.

## Architecture Evolution

### Current Architecture
- Single EC2 instance hosting all components
- Monolithic application handling multiple concerns
- Basic S3 integration for storage
- Limited scalability and potential single points of failure

### Proposed Architecture
- Distributed microservices architecture
- Global CDN for content delivery
- Containerized services with orchestration
- Enhanced storage and caching layers
- Comprehensive observability and security measures

## Key Components

### Frontend Layer
- Global CDN integration
- Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution
- Optimized content delivery

### Core Services
1. **Authentication Service**
   - Secure user authentication and authorization
   - Token-based access management

2. **Image Processing Services**
   - Image ingestion service
   - Image serving service
   - Search and indexing services
   - Direct third-party integrations where needed

### Infrastructure
1. **Caching Layer**
   - Redis-based caching
   - Performance optimization

2. **Data Storage**
   - S3 for image storage
   - Elasticsearch for search capabilities
   - Optimized data access patterns

### Operations
1. **Observability**
   - Comprehensive monitoring
   - Logging and tracing
   - Performance metrics

2. **Security**
   - Multi-layer security approach
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Access control and authentication

3. **Cost Optimization**
   - Resource utilization monitoring
   - Auto-scaling policies
   - Cost-effective storage solutions
